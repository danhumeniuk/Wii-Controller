# Wii-Controller

Wii-Controller extracts the sensor data from your Wii Balance Board.

This project is heavily modified from https://github.com/aelveborn/Wii-Scale and the original code can be found there. This fork
removes most of the web interface as well as weighing aspects of the original project and only collects the output from any connected
Wii Balance Board.

Wii-Controller is based on C++.
